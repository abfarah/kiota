# Kiota Abstractions

On most platforms there are a range of different HTTP client library implementations. Developers often have preferences on which is the best implementation to meet their needs. Kiota's objective is to make it easier to create a HTTP request object but attempts to be agnostic of the library that will make the HTTP call. In order to decouple Kiota from specific HTTP libraries, we have defined a set of abstractions.

## HTTP Core

The HTTP core interface is the primary point where Kiota service libraries will trigger the creation of a HTTP request.

```csharp
    public interface IHttpCore {
        Task<ModelType> SendAsync<ModelType>(RequestInfo requestInfo, IResponseHandler responseHandler = default);    
    }
```

Kiota service libraries return the model type that is associated with HTTP resource. This behavior can be overriden by changing the `responseHandler` to do something different than default behavior.  One use of this is to change the response type to be either a native HTTP response class, or return a generic API response class that provides access to more underlying metadata.

## RequestInfo

In order to enable Kiota service libraries to make requests, they need to be able accumulate information about the request and pass it to the core library. The RequestInfo object is designed to do that. It only contains properties that be provided by the request builders. As request builders get more sophisticated, so may the RequestInfo class.

```csharp
public class RequestInfo
    {
        public Uri URI { get; set; }
        public HttpMethod HttpMethod { get; set; }
        public IDictionary<string, object> QueryParameters { get; set; } = new Dictionary<string, object>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        public IDictionary<string, string> Headers { get; set; } = new Dictionary<string, string>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        public Stream Content { get; set; }
    }
```

```TypeScript
export interface RequestInfo {
    URI?: URL;
    httpMethod?: HttpMethod;
    content?: ReadableStream;
    queryParameters?: Map<string, object>;
    headers?: Map<string, string>;
}
```

```java
public class RequestInfo {
    @Nullable
    public URI uri;
    @Nullable
    public HttpMethod httpMethod;
    @Nonnull
    public HashMap<String, Object> queryParameters = new HashMap<>(); //TODO case insensitive
    @Nonnull
    public HashMap<String, String> headers = new HashMap<>(); // TODO case insensitive
    @Nullable
    public InputStream Content;
}
```

## ResponseHandler

TBD
- This allows core to do all the default hard work, but enables a custom response handler to change the behavior of the method.

```CSharp
    public interface IResponseHandler 
    {
        Task<ModelType> HandleResponseAsync<NativeResponseType, ModelType>(NativeResponseType response);
    }
```
